He supplied me with footage of a snake navigating obstacles while sidewinding, and I was tasked with developing two controllers to test his theories of how the snake was creating this behavior.  The first was an active controller; it compared measured torque versus expected torque for all the joints and would try and use that to guess when it was hitting an obstacle and deform appropriately. The second was an attempt to emulate the way muscles work.  When a joint was moving in a particular direction, it would resist change against the actuation force, while permitting change with the force.  Ultimately we found that the second controller more closely resembled the movement of biological snakes.
